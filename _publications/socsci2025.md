excerpt: 'This study empirically tests the time-displacement hypothesis, examining if early adolescents` mobile phone use displaces time spent on developmentally beneficial activities. The results challenge the time-displacement hypothesis, providing no evidence that early adolescents spend less time on enrichment, physical activity, or sleep after acquiring their first mobile phone. Instead, acquiring their first mobile phone is associated with a significant reduction in time spent watching TV, movies, or videos. This suggests that the historic rise in adolescent mobile phone use may partly reflect a shift away from traditional screen-based activities rather than a displacement of developmentally beneficial activities.'
